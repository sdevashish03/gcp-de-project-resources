Objective: Design a comprehensive, end-to-end data engineering project on Google Cloud Platform (GCP) suitable for hands-on learning using a free tier account. The project will simulate a realistic data pipeline for a near-live data source, adhering to corporate standards with distinct development (DEV/BLD), integration (INT), and curation (PRD/curation) environments, each with Raw and Staging and curation layers. Significant data transformations will occur between environments.
Task: Develop a detailed, step-by-step guide for implementing this project, covering the following aspects:
1. Project Architecture & Environment Setup:
GCP Service Utilization: Clearly outline how Cloud Composer, Dataflow, BigQuery, and Terraform will be integrated within the project.
Environment Strategy: Detail the purpose and structure of the DEV/BLD (Raw, Stg, curation), INT (Raw, Stg, curation), and PRD (Raw, Stg, curation) environments. Explain the data flow and transformation logic between these environments.
Git Repository Structure: Define the detailed folder structure and navigation within the three specified Git repositories:
1.	gcp-de-project-resources (Terraform)
2.	gcp-de-data-pipeline (Composer DAG, Dataflow code)
GCP Environment Setup: Provide granular, command-line or console-based steps for setting up the necessary GCP resources (BigQuery datasets, initial tables) in the 3 layers of BLD, INT, and prod environments using Terraform. Include best practices for free tier resource management.

2. Data Ingestion (Simulated Live Stream):

Free Tier Strategy: Propose a practical and realistic approach to simulate a continuous data stream within the free tier limitations. This could involve:
Ingesting data from a CSV file that is landed regularly on a daily basis with new data in GCS bucket.
Implementation Details: Provide specific instructions and example code (if applicable) for the chosen data ingestion method within the Dataflow pipeline.

3. Data Processing (Dataflow):

Transformation Logic: Detail the data cleaning and transformation steps performed by the Dataflow pipeline. This should include transformations required to move data from the initial ingested format into the Raw, Staging and curation layers within the DEV/BLD, INT and prod environments.
Based on the input data, provide me with advanced transformations required in the dataflow pipeline and help us code the same.
Python Code: Provide well-commented and efficient Python code snippets for the Dataflow pipeline, demonstrating the use of Apache Beam transformations.

4. Data Warehousing (BigQuery):

Loading Strategy: Explain how Dataflow will load the processed data into the appropriate BigQuery tables within the Raw, Staging and curation layers of the DEV/BLD, INT and prod environments.
Table Schemas: Define example schemas for the tables in the Raw and Staging layers.

6. Orchestration (Cloud Composer):

DAG Design: Describe the design of the Cloud Composer DAG, including the tasks involved (triggering Dataflow), their dependencies, and scheduling.
DAG Definition: Provide a well-commented example of the Cloud Composer DAG definition (Python code).
Configuration: Explain how to configure the DAG to interact with Dataflow.

7. Git Management and Environment Promotion:

Repository Initialization: Provide instructions on how to initialize and manage the three Git repositories.
Code Promotion: Detail a strategy for promoting code and configurations (Terraform, Dataflow, Composer DAG) across the BLD, INT, and curation environments, adhering to corporate standards (e.g., using Git branches, pull requests).

8. Running and Monitoring the Pipeline:

Execution Instructions: Provide clear, step-by-step instructions on how to run the entire data pipeline, including triggering the Cloud Composer DAG.
Monitoring Strategies: Outline how to monitor the pipeline's execution and identify potential issues using GCP monitoring tools (Cloud Logging, Dataflow monitoring, Composer UI, BigQuery query history).
Emphasis: The solution should be practical for learning within the free tier, demonstrate realistic data engineering workflows, adhere to corporate environment separation, showcase significant transformations, and provide clear, well-documented, and efficient code examples for each component. The explanation should guide a learner through the entire implementation process.



‚ÄÉ
Excellent ‚Äî you are asking for a real-world, corporate-grade data engineering project that runs on GCP Free Tier and still follows best practices (Dev, Int, Prod, Infra as Code, GitOps, and full orchestration)!
I‚Äôll build this guide in a very detailed, step-by-step, copy-paste friendly format, with realistic assumptions.
